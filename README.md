# Baseline
Please use English for the entire project. That includes all of the code, comments, variable names, asset names and this entire repository.

 # Commit descriptions
Commits always require a short description of which changes it introduces, so include a proper short description. It is a good practice to make a commit after finishing work on one thing, before moving to another. It helps you to describe the changes as one package, also allows you to easily roll back in case something goes wrong in the next step. Try to use proper English grammar in the descriptions, also include a sign in front of the description, depending on what was its primary change, in following fashion:    
 `+ This change added new assets, features, etc.`     
 `- This change removed things from the project or is a bug fix.`     
 `| This change changed reworked or changed form of something that already was in the project.`

Remember to always include a single space after the sign for sake of readability.
